# MACD Indicator Optimization with ML

## Project Description
* Buy signals generated by the MACD indicator's histogram is optimized. 
* Data Service contains a script to automatically collect historical candle data
* Algorithms implemented from scratch: 
    - __Logistic Regression__ with L2 Regularization, Mini-Bacth & Stochastic Gradient Descend and Class Weights
    - __K-Nearest Neighbors__ with Cosine Similarity, Euclidean Distance, Manhattan Distance
    - __Na√Øve Bayes Classifier__ (Categorical and Gaussian)
* Most of the pre-processing pipeline will be kept confidential as well as the features used
* More detailed information can be find at reports/Final_Report.pdf
